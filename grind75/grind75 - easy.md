# Two sum (classic)(1)
### statement
Given an array of integers `nums`Â and an integer `target`, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to `target`_.

You may assume that each input would have **_exactly_ one solution**, and you may not use the _same_ element twice.

You can return the answer in any order.

### solution
the first thought would be to use two for loops. but it has a time complexity of O(n^2). we can rather iterate through the array and storing each element of the array into a dictionary, with the element as the key and its index as the value. while iterating, at each step we can also find the *complement* or the *needed value* for each iteration and if that value exists we can just simply return the value of that key and the current position. else, just add that into the dictionary.

if no such numbers were found, then return an empty list.
time complexity: O(n)

# Valid parenthesis (20)
### description
Given a string `s` containing just the characters `'('`, `')'`, `'{'`, `'}'`, `'['` and `']'`, determine if the input string is valid.

An input string is valid if:

1. Open brackets must be closed by the same type of brackets.
2. Open brackets must be closed in the correct order.
3. Every close bracket has a corresponding open bracket of the same type.


### solution
obviously we need to use stack to handle this. thankfully python has negative indexing and hence there is no need to keep track of top. if we find an opening brace, then we can simply append it into our stack. but for closing brace, we need to check if the corresponding opening brace is present at the top of the stack.

for each closing brace, we are also checking if the stack is empty aswell.
at the end, if our stack becomes empty, then all the opening braces has a corresponding closing brace and it is properly arranged. and hence the stack becomes empty. and we can just return true.


# Merge two sorted lists (21)
### description
You are given the heads of two sorted linked lists `list1` and `list2`.

Merge the two lists into one **sorted** list. The list should be made by splicing together the nodes of the first two lists.

Return _the head of the merged linked list_.

### solution
since this uses linked lists, i prefer to use C. but the logic is just the same. there are two approaches, recursion and iterative approach. \

#### recursion
first we assign some base conditions, like if list1 is empty, then just return list2 pointer and vice-versa. 
we check condition if the current value of the list1 is greater or lesser than list2 and then update the next pointer with recursion. but when doing the recursion we call it with the next value of the selected list. so that it can also do its thing and compare. \
when either one of the lists reaches its end, i.e at NULL, then the base condition triggers, that returns the non-empty list and this value will be stored in the previous recursion call's `list->next`. once that is resolved, it will return that particular list's current pointer.

here's a visual representation of whats happening, 
![](https://blog-pictures.vercel.app/merge2.png) 

please do mind that, by `returned values` i am referring to the line after `list->next`. each recursion return passes the lower value back up the stack connecting it to the previous smaller node found in the previous call.
this would mean `2000->1000->2010->1010->2020->1010`
idk i think this might have been a bad explanation pls forgive me.
the other approach is a lot simpler.

#### iterative approach
again, we first check if any of the list is empty, then if it is, then return the head of the other list. pretty simple. for the next step, we first try to initiate a pointer to the smaller of the first element of both of the lists. so that we can get the right starting point. if the first element of the first list is smaller, then we will modify the pointers of the first list. once we've done that, we shall also update the pointer of the selected list to the next element since that is already there. then we iterate until either one of the lists reaches the end. while iterating we check for condition and then accordingly update pointers. pretty straightforward. and also don't forget to change the current pointer to point to the next after each iteration, after checking for condition. once we reached the end of one of the list, we check which one still has values and the  update our list to that list.

# Best time to buy and sell stock (121)
### Description
You are given an array `prices` where `prices[i]` is the price of a given stock on the `ith` day.

You want to maximize your profit by choosing a **single day** to buy one stock and choosing a **different day in the future** to sell that stock.

Return _the maximum profit you can achieve from this transaction_. If you cannot achieve any profit, return `0`.

### Solution
and no, as much as we'd like to use nested for loop and call it a day, it is greatly inefficient. it gets the job done if our data is less. but the higher you go in size, the longer it is gonna take. \
to proceed with this, first we will need to initiate our minimum value to a big number. like infinity. and with python this is possible. now as we go through each price in the list, we keep track of the minimum value and then try to calculate what would be our max profit outcome from subtracting the current item in the iteration to the current minimum. pretty basic.

# Valid Palindrome (125)
### description
A phrase is a **palindrome** if, after converting all uppercase letters into lowercase letters and removing all non-alphanumeric characters, it reads the same forward and backward. Alphanumeric characters include letters and numbers.

Given a string `s`, return `true` _if it is a **palindrome**, or_ `false` _otherwise_.

### solution
split the string into an array of all the characters. with each character as an element of its own (or use a generator expression). and then just join it with ''.join
