the question is structured? or unstructured?

so we can go for a flexible, unstructured way
our blogs schema can be of the form:
\_id: which is the mongo default id
id: for actually managing each blog. will be using `nanoid`. this is for blog management and in application operations
content: String? or need to find a way for markdown? if i wanna be able to upload pictures.
