## Features i wanna implement
- different blogs classified based on topics
- topics are: leetcode, webdevelopment, aiml, and should be scalable
- the home page should be the classification page where user is able to see all the topics only 
- a secret url that only i know the url to. the link to the url will not be visible to the normal user. inside the url again i need authentication
- for each classified topic, there should be multiple blogs
- when clicked on that should take to another webpage that has the full description of it. ? or do i want it to just maximize it like how it works in google notes
- markdown implementation? 
- how can i manage the notes? structured or no structure just pure json
